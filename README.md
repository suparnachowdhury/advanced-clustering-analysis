## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates practical implementation of three major clustering algorithms to uncover hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Using a real-world City Lifestyle dataset, I explore how different clustering approaches reveal distinct customer segments and behavioral patterns.

**Business Context:** Customer segmentation is crucial for targeted marketing, personalized services, and strategic decision-making. This project showcases how unsupervised learning can transform raw data into actionable business insights.

## 🧮 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **K-Means Clustering**
- Centroid-based partitioning algorithm
- Optimal cluster selection using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Feature scaling and PCA visualization
- Detailed cluster interpretation and profiling

### 2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
- Agglomerative (bottom-up) approach
- Dendrogram visualization for cluster hierarchy
- Multiple linkage methods comparison (Ward, Complete, Average)
- Nested cluster structure analysis


## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [City Lifestyle Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

**Features:**
- Population Density
- Average Income
- Air Pollution Index
- Happiness Score
- Green Space Ratio
- Internet Penetration
- Public Transport Score
- Rental Costs


The dataset contains socioeconomic and environmental indicators for various cities, making it ideal for discovering lifestyle-based segments.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Complete preprocessing pipeline** (handling missing values, feature scaling, outlier detection)
- ✅ **Multiple evaluation metrics** (Inertia, Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index)
- ✅ **Rich visualizations** (2D/3D scatter plots, dendrograms, heatmaps, elbow curves)
- ✅ **Cluster interpretation** with business insights
- ✅ **Comparative analysis** of all three algorithms
- ✅ **Well-documented code** with detailed comments
- ✅ **Reproducible results** (random seeds set)

## Results & Insights

### K-Means Clustering (K=3)

**Cluster 1: Prosperous Low-Stress Communities (50% of cities)**

- High socioeconomic index
- Low urban stress and pollution
- High green comfort
- Strong affordability balance
- Business Application: Prime targets for premium services, lifestyle brands, and sustainable urban development initiatives

**Cluster 2: Low-Income Peripheral Areas (29% of cities)**

- Low income and technology penetration
- Moderate environmental quality
- Limited infrastructure
- Business Application: Opportunities for affordable housing, basic infrastructure development, and digital inclusion programs

**Cluster 3: Dense, High-Stress Urban Centers (21% of cities)**

- Very high urban stress and pollution
- Moderate technology infrastructure
- Poor green comfort and affordability
- Business Application: Need for environmental remediation, affordable housing solutions, and stress-reduction services
